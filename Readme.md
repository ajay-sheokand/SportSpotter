This web application helps people navigate to their nearby Sport venues. 

For now, this is just limited to the city of MÃ¼nster which is in Germany.

This web app uses google maps to help with the navigation however, all the data about the venue is hosted on the app itself.

People can sign-up on the web application with their email, which is currently hosted by FireBase, and after signing up the users are able to add an event on the web app.
